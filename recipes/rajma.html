    <p>A hearty bowl of rajma.</p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Rajma</strong>, a North Indian comfort food classic, is a hearty,
      soul-satisfying dish made from red kidney beans simmered in a thick,
      spiced tomato gravy. Think of it as India&apos;s answer to chili, but with
      a <em>deeper, more aromatic flavor profile</em> thanks to layers of cumin,
      coriander, ginger, garlic and garam masala.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditionally, it&apos;s served with steamed basmati rice, hence the
      beloved pairing <em>rajma chawal</em>, though it&apos;s equally delicious
      with roti or naan. Below, is a
      <strong><em>quick and easy, one pot recipe</em></strong> using a pressure
      cooker.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tbsps of olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 red onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 tsp of garlic paste</li>
      <li>1 tsp of ginger paste</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of tomato puree</li>
      <li>Spices:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>1 clove</li>
        <li>1 cardamom pod</li>
        <li>A small piece of cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tsp sambar powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp chilli powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cumin powder</li>
        <li>A pinch of garam masala</li>
      </ul>
      <li>1 can of red kidney beans, drained and rinsed</li>
      <li>1/3 cup of water</li>
      <li>3 tsps salt</li>
      <li>1 tsp of jaggery powder</li>
      <li>(Optional) 2-3 sticks of coriander, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>To a small pressure cooker over medium heat, add the oil.</li>
      <li>
        Add in the clove, cinnamon and cardamom pod. (<strong>Tip:</strong>
        Ensure the pod has been split for a richer aroma.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chopped onion, as well as the spoons of ginger and garlic paste.
        Stir well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the tomato puree. To this, add the remainder of the powdered spices.
        Mix thoroughly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the kidney beans. Pour in the water, add the jaggery and salt.
        Mix well and taste. (<strong>Tip:</strong> Now is the best time to
        modify the flavour of the curry if you wish to.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue mixing over medium heat until the oil separates and the mixture
        develops a glossy sheen.
      </li>
      <li>
        At this stage, close the pressure cooker securely and add a standard
        weight to the steam vent. Set the stove to the
        <strong><em>lowest</em></strong> heat setting and wait for 2 whistles.
        This should take around 15-20 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the second whistle sounds, turn off the heat.
        <strong
          >DO NOT OPEN at this stage, as the vessel is still
          pressurised!</strong
        >
        Wait for a further 10 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        After some time has elapsed, gently nudge the weight of the pressure
        cooker to see if built-up steam is still being released. If the sound of
        the steam being released is feeble, remove the weight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open the lid of the pressure cooker and check the consistency of the
        rajma. If required, reduce over medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>(Optional) Add chopped coriander and stir well.</li>
      <li>Serve with rice, roti or a bread of your choosing.</li>
    </ol>
